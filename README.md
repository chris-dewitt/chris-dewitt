# Hi, I’m Chris DeWitt

I’m a finance analyst specializing in Asset Liability Management (ALM) & interest rate risk (IRR). I'm interested in learning how to develop analytical tools to better understand how rate markets and balance sheet dynamics interact.

### What I’m working on

- A modular ALM dashboard for simulating IRR and EVE impacts under different rate and liquidity scenarios
- Tools for pricing IRR/FX derivatives with stress-testing and risk attribution
- Sentiment analysis on FOMC releases

### Interests

- Bank funding & interest rate modeling  
- Macro rate strategy & derivatives pricing
